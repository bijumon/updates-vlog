ref: [Python 3's f-Strings: An Improved String Formatting Syntax (Guide) â€“ Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python)

**Hint**: return a formatted string literal from the function, with a [default argument value](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values) when `name` isn't given. It is possible to use [%-formatting](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#option-1-formatting) or [str.format()](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#option-2-strformat) to solve this.

``` python
# two_fer.py
def two_fer(name="you"):
    answer = f"One for {name}, one for me."
    return answer

# two_fer_test.py
import unittest

from two_fer import two_fer

# Tests adapted from `problem-specifications//canonical-data.json` @ v1.2.0

class TwoFerTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_name_given(self):
        self.assertEqual(two_fer(), "One for you, one for me.")

    def test_a_name_given(self):
        self.assertEqual(two_fer("Alice"), "One for Alice, one for me.")

    def test_another_name_given(self):
        self.assertEqual(two_fer("Bob"), "One for Bob, one for me.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
