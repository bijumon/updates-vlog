A Problem Book contains a collection of mathematical or other problems,
with enough theory as guidelines and a collection of links to other
resources. We use a single ipython document for each book.

-   Number theory, Koshy
-   Burman
-   Groups using Sagemath (rubiks cube)
-   pre-algebra with geometry and trignometry (use d3.js to construct a
    unit circle animation)
-   Calculus with problems
-   101 triangles
